# Huffman compression
Completed task on subject Mathematical modeling

Application for text compression with [Huffman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). Alphabet is generated from the message itself. Compressed message is self-contained and consists of encoded alphabet and payload, and holds all necessary data to decode the message.

## Features
* Compress message and embed alphabet
* Decode alphabet from compressed data and restore original message
* Implements GUI for application
* Visualizes Huffman coding tree for compression and decompression
